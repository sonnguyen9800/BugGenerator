<h1> BUG GENERATOR </h1>


<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> A group of friend asked me to create a program to generate random bugs on the screen. This
is done for the purpose of video making in the club campus. So i made it</p>

<h2> How to use</h2>
<p>Run the program with python3, add flag to true/false to display fake logs of error/sucess state</p>

<p>Hit enter to swap between error/sucess state</p>
